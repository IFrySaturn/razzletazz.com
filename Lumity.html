    <h1>My opinion on Lumity</h1>
    <h2>I don't like Lumity, but it's not for the reason you think.</h2>
    <p>Lumity is a femslash canon ship in the Disney series The Owl House. It is regarded as one of the best
        relationships in the entire Disney series fandom, but i don't feel the same.</p>
    <img src="assets/LumityLast.JPEG.webp" alt="Lumity picture" title="Disgusting..." style="width: 250px;">
    <p>On my own personal opinion, i feel like the relationship development was rushed, probably because TOH was
        cancelled and they had to pretty much shorten everything.<br>It all felt like it was rushed and forced, it's
        also not accurate. Who falls in love with the person you bully? Unless they got some mental disorder i cannot
        think of a reason why.<br>
        Still, there are hardcore shippers that would literally <a
            href="https://theowlhouse.fandom.com/f/p/4400000000000203124/r/4400000000001833636">label you as
            homophobic</a> just because you don't like Lumity, <b>no matter what the reason, no matter how careful you
            choose your words, no matter how respectful you are,</b> if you don't like Lumity, <b>you're homophobic and
            a disgrace to society.</b><br>
        I'm sorry stupid dumbass shippers, if you cannot agree with a person who doesn't like a ship and feel like it's
        necessary to attack them and label them as homophobic, the disgrace to society is <b>YOU.</b><br>
        I'm saying my opinions with respect, why cannot you respect me back? And don't get me started with those who try
        make people change their mind about their shipping opinions. <i>You don't like this ship? You're wrong, you
            better like it, in fact, there's reasons why you should like it.</i> Stfu, i have my opinions and reasons,
        and you don't have to try and change my opinions. Do i even try to change your opinion about TOH?<br>I've also read how one shipper <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/f/p/4400000000000502152">LITERALLY laughed at someone's grandfather passing just because they didn't agree with Lumity.</a> Does this make the fandom look good? Of course not! Idiot.</p>
    <p>It's god damn annoying how <b>some</b> shippers behave, they always feel like they're in the right, and have the
        right to insult those who don't agree with, same goes with <a href="https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/Nuzi">Nuzi
            from Murder Drones</a>.</p>
    <p>Thanks to these godawful shitty shippers, i cannot enjoy ships, they ruin it by their stupid beliefs, and the
        fact that i'm <b>AroAce</b>, it just makes it worse.</p>
    <p>That's the reason why i don't like the main popular ships of series, not only Lumity, but Nuzi in MD, Rupphire in
        the case of Steven Universe, and many others. I'd rather ship rather low popularity ships or ships with a small
        fanbase, such as Huntlow, Oilrose, and Lapidot.</p>
    <p>Now, (thanks for reading)/(i'm sorry for making you read) my little rant... but it's something i always wanted to
        get off my chest.</p>
    <p>Oh, and by the way, if you're a shipper that cannot stand others people's opinion, do me a favor and</p>
